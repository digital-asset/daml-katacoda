This scenario uses the custom environment `daml-sdk-env`. The environment was built following the [Getting Started](https://docs.daml.com/getting-started/installation.html) guide.

The id of the image is defined in the index.json

```
"backend": {
  "imageid": "daml-sdk-env"
}
```

Now you can use daml:
`daml version`{{execute}}
