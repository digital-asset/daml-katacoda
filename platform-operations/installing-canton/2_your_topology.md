The first question we need to address is what the topology is that you are going after. The Canton topology is made up of parties, participants and domains, as depicted in the following figure.

The Daml code will run on the participant node and expresses smart contracts between parties. Parties are hosted on participant nodes. Participant nodes will synchronise their state with other participant nodes by exchanging messages with each other through domains. Domains are nodes that integrate with the underlying storage technology such as databases or other distributed ledgers. As the Canton protocol is written in a way that assumes that Participant nodes donâ€™t trust each other, you would normally expect that every organisation runs only one participant node, except for scaling purposes.

If you want to build up a test-network for yourself, you need at least a participant node and a domain.
