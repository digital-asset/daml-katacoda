For our convenience in this guide, we will use a few environment variables to refer to a set of directions. Please set the environment variable “CANTON” to point to the place where you have unpacked the canton release bundle.

```
cd ./canton-open-source-2.2.0
export CANTON=`pwd`
```{{execute T2}}

And then set another variable that points to the advanced example directory

```
export CONF="$CANTON/examples/03-advanced-configuration"
```{{execute T2}}
