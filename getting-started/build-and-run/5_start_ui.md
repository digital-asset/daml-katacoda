We can now start the UI by running 

```
npm start
```{{execute T1}}

This starts the web UI which will connect to our JSON API server. 
Once the web UI has been compiled and started, you should see `Compiled successfully!` in your terminal. 

Now [open the UI tab](https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-3000-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com) to see your running application and continue to the next step to see what you can do with it.
