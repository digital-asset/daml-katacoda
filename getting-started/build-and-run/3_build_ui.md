Now, in the second terminal we will go to the `ui/` folder of the `create-daml-app` and use `npm` to install the dependencies for the UI:

```
cd create-daml-app/ui
npm install
```{{execute T2}}

This step may take a couple of moments. You'll be back to the terminal prompt `$` once the process is done.
