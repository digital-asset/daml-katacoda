This is the first in a series of four tutorials to get you up and running with full-stack Daml development. We do this through the example of a simple social networking application. The three tutorials cover:

1. How to build and run the application (this tutorial)
1. How to write a [new feature for the app](https://daml.com/learn/getting-started/your-first-feature/)
1. How to deploy your app to [Daml Hub](https://www.daml.com/learn/getting-started/deploy-to-dabl/)

You can also read more about the [architecture of this application here](https://docs.daml.com/getting-started/app-architecture.html)

The final application will look something like this:

By the end of this tutorial, you’ll have a good idea of the following:

1. What Daml contracts and ledgers are.
1. How a user interface (UI) interacts with a Daml ledger.
1. How Daml helps you build a real-life application fast.
1. How you can deploy your app to a locally hosted environment.

With that, let’s get started!
