The Daml code defines the data and workflow of the application; you can read about this in more detail in the [application architecture](https://docs.daml.com/getting-started/app-architecture.html). The workflow aspect refers to the interactions between parties that are permitted by the system. In the context of a messaging feature, these are essentially the authorization and privacy concerns listed above.

For the authorization part, we take the following approach: a user Bob can message another user Alice when Alice starts following Bob back. When Alice starts following Bob back, she gives permission and authority to Bob to send her a message.

To implement this workflow, let’s start by adding the new data for messages.

- First, **open the IDE tab and wait for it to load.** You should see the IDE, similiar to the screen below, before proceeding with the next step.

- After that click on the button `Copy to Editor` to add the code snippet to the end of the `User.daml` file. Indentation is important: it should be at the top level like the original User template.

<pre class="file" data-filename="daml/User.daml" data-target="append">
template Message with
    sender: Party
    receiver: Party
    content: Text
  where
    signatory sender, receiver
</pre>

This template is very simple: it contains the data for a message and no choices. The interesting part is the signatory clause: both the sender and receiver are signatories on the template. This enforces the fact that creation and archival of `Message` contracts must be authorized by both parties.

Now we can add messaging into the workflow by adding a new choice to the `User` template.

- Open the `daml/User.daml`{{open}} file
- Copy the below choice by clicking on the `Copy to Clipboard` button

<pre class="file" data-target="clipboard">
    nonconsuming choice SendMessage: ContractId Message with
          sender: Party
          content: Text
        controller sender
        do
          assertMsg "Designated user must follow you back to send a message" (elem sender following)
          create Message with sender, receiver = username, content
</pre>

- Finally paste the code into the `User` template after the `Follow` choice. **The indentation for the SendMessage choice must match the one of Follow. Make sure you save the file after copying the code.**

As with the `Follow` choice, there are a few aspects to note here.

- By convention, the choice returns the `ContractId` of the resulting `Message` contract.
- The parameters to the choice are the sender and content of this message; the receiver is the party named on this `User` contract.
- The controller clause states that it is the sender who can exercise the choice.
- The body of the choice first ensures that the sender is a user that the receiver is following and then creates the `Message` contract with the receiver being the signatory of the `User` contract.
- This completes the workflow for messaging in our app. Now let’s integrate this functionality into the UI.
