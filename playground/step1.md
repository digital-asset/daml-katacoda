Welcome to the DAML SDK Playground.

A sample project has been created for you and you are in the project root dir. You can open the IDE by clicking on the IDE tab above the terminal.

If you want to start the project, run `daml start --open-browser=no`{{execute}}. Once started, you can then open the Navigator at https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-7500-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/, and the JSON API at https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-7575-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/.

Additional terminal windows can be opened using the `+` above the terminal.
