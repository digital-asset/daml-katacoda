In this scenario you learned how to model data with Daml. You now know

  - how to write your own data types
  - structure your code into modules and import them
  - how to import the standard library

In the next Katacoda of the [fundamental concepts](https://digitalasset.com/developers/interactive-tutorials/fundamental-concepts)
course you will take a tour of [Daml's standard library](https://digitalasset.com/developers/interactive-tutorials/fundamental-concepts/stdlib-tour), where you'll see common container types like
lists, maps, sets and optional data.

Come and connect with the Daml Community on the [Daml forum](https://discuss.daml.com) and share
your insights, questions and suggestions!
