This scenario introduced you to Daml triggers.

- You now understand the concept of a Daml trigger as a tool for automation.
- You learned how to write a trigger by implementing a Daml.Trigger data structure.
- You learned how to run a trigger from the command line with the `daml trigger` command.

Keep an eye open for the coming [Daml trigger
service](https://docs.daml.com/tools/trigger-service.html). The Trigger Service provides the means
to host multiple triggers for multiple parties running against a common ledger in a single process
and provides a convenient interface for starting, stopping and monitoring them. This will make
trigger deployment a lot easier in a production environment when you have many triggers for
different parties running.

As always, if you have any questions or problems, connect with the Daml Community on the [Daml
forum](https://discuss.daml.com).
