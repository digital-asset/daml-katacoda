Instead of writing a script in a Daml source file, you can also connect to the ledger with the
Daml REPL and run your commands interactively step by step. This is very helpful if you are trying
to get a better feel for how your code works.

First, kill the running sandbox in the first terminal (ctrl-c) and restart it to get back into a
clean state.

```
daml sandbox .daml/dist/create-daml-app-0.1.0.dar
```{{execute T1}}

To start the Daml REPL run

```
daml repl --ledger-host=localhost --ledger-port=6865 .daml/dist/create-daml-app-0.1.0.dar
```{{execute T2}}

in the **second** terminal. After a few seconds you'll see the REPL prompt:

```
daml>
```

You can always exit the Daml REPL by pressing `ctrl-c` and get help with

```
:help
```{{execute T2}}

At the REPL prompt you can issue an arbitrary Daml script command. As before we'll allocate a new
party:

```
alice <- allocatePartyWithHint "Alice" (PartyIdHint "Alice")
```{{execute T2}}

To have definitions of the `User.daml` module in scope, we need to load it first with

```
:m User
```{{execute T2}}

You can create a new `User` contract for `Alice` by submitting a `createCmd` command:

```
aliceCid <- submit alice (createCmd User.User with username = alice, following = [])
```{{execute T2}}

Here `aliceCid` is the contract ID of the `User` contract that just got created. We can confirm that
the contract has been created by a query:

```
contracts <- query @User.User alice
```{{execute T2}}

To inspect the contracts variable, you can simply use a `debug` statement:

```
debug contracts
```{{execute T2}}

```
[DA.Internal.Prelude:540]: [(<contract-id>,User {username = 'Alice', following = []})]
```

1. as expected, the `contracts` variable contains the single contract `Alice` we just created
1. note that the first entry of the tuple is an opaque contract ID, indicated by
   `<contract-id>`. The representation of contract ID's is internal to the ledger you are using.
   Hence it's represented as an opaque in the `REPL`.

As an exercise, try to allocate another party `Bob` and issue an `exerciseCmd` to make `Alice`
follow `Bob`! Step by step you can build your social network.

Everything you learned for Daml scripts also works in the Daml REPL! This can be a powerful tool to
run through your Daml code and check the ledger state with queries and `debug` statements.
