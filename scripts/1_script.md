With Daml scripts you can specify a linear sequence of actions that different parties take, and
these are evaluated in order, according to the same consistency, authorization and privacy rules as
they would be on any production ledger. Every script you specify is run automaticallya against an
in-memory ledger in the IDE.

In this Katacoda, we'll extend the social network defined in `daml/User.daml` with test scripts.

- First, **open the IDE and wait for it to load**.
- After that click on `daml/User.daml`{{open}} to open the `User.daml` file.
- You can click on `Copy to Editor` to append the following code snippets to the file as you go.
  **Note that indentation matters**.

To write Daml scripts you need to import the `Daml.Script` module. Replace the module header with

<pre class="file" data-target="clipboard">
module User where

import Daml.Script hiding(User)
</pre>

The Daml script library exposes a type called User which corresponds to a user in the [user management service](https://docs.daml.com/app-dev/services.html#user-management-service). To avoid a collision with the `User` template we defined here, we hide it from the import.

A script starts with a name assigned to a `script do` block.

<pre class="file" data-filename="daml/User.daml" data-target="append">
test =
  script do
</pre>

We want two parties `Alice` and `Bob` to be known identites on our simulated ledger. You can
allocate them with the `allocateParty` function:

<pre class="file" data-filename="daml/User.daml" data-target="append">
    alice <- allocateParty "Alice"
    bob <- allocateParty "Bob"
</pre>

The ledger is now ready and you can simulate how the two parties submit transactions.  Suppose,
`Alice` and `Bob` sign up to your social network. For this they will create a `User` template each.

<pre class="file" data-filename="daml/User.daml" data-target="append">
    aliceCid <- submit alice do
      createCmd User with username = alice; following = []
    submit bob do
      createCmd User with username = bob; following = []
</pre>

Note how both parties submit their action as a transaction contained in a do block. Further, we bind
the result of `Alice`'s submission to a variable `aliceCid`. We will be using this contract ID in
the next step.

The `createCmd` is analogous to the usual `create` in `Update` blocks of choices. Similar, there is
also an `archiveCmd` for archiving contracts and `exerciseCmd`, respectively `exerciseByKeyCmd` for
exercising choices on contracts. You find all available script commands
[here](https://docs.daml.com/daml-script/api/Daml-Script.html#functions).

Did you notice the popped up `Script results`? Indeed, `Alice`'s and `Bob`'s transaction were
successful and the ledger has changed. In the next step, you'll find out how to inspect the ledger
in the IDE.
