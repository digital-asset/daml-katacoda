In the [previous tutorial](https://daml.com/interactive-tutorials/upgrading/upgrading-daml-models) you learned how
to write a migration contract that prescribes how to migrate live data of the getting started social
network to a newer version. However, moving contracts manually with the navigator is tedious and
would soon become unfeasible for big data sets.

In this final tutorial on upgrading Daml applications, you will learn how to drive the upgrading
process from the UI.
